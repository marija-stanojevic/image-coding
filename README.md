<h3> Lossy image compression using DCT (Fall 2013) </h3>

This project takes grey photos and compreses them using discrete cosine transformation (DCT) algorithm. <br/>
Algorithm and interface are implemented in C#. Samples of images can be found in the project folder and compressed images are saved as kodirano.jpg. <br/>
You can read details about algorithm here: https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~lmlui/dct.pdf. <br/>
Project is developed in Slovenian language as part of Multimedia class in fall 2013. <br/>
